This project is part of my Mentorness Internship, where I analyzed a dataset of YouTube songs to uncover insights using Power BI. The dataset includes various attributes such as view counts, like counts, comment counts, and song durations.


Project Objectives
•	Understand engagement patterns for YouTube songs.
•	Identify popular songs based on view and like counts.
•	Analyze trends in viewer interactions.


Key Features
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handled missing values, converted data formats, and ensured data consistency.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Created visualizations to explore view counts, like counts, and comment counts.
•	Power BI Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard to present the findings with various visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.


Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into the engagement and preferences of YouTube viewers. It was a great learning experience in data analysis and visualization, enhancing my skills in Power BI and data interpretation.


Future Work
•	Analyze additional factors such as song genre and upload time.
•	Incorporate more recent data for updated trends.
